          <h2>Hello !</h2>
          <p class="intro">I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer (MEng), graduate of Technical University of Crete.Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, including Databases, Signal and 
            Image processing, Machine Learning, Autonomous Agents, and Cloud Engineering. However, I have found a particular 
            passion for <i>Software Development</i> and <i>System Security</i>, and have dedicated much of my time to learning and honing my 
            skills in these areas</p>

              <h3>Integration Developer at Deloitte</h3>
              <h5>February 2023 - Present</h5>
              <p>Focused on Boomi, a leading integration platform, to establish seamless connections between disparate systems and enhance 
                operational efficiency. Holding five certifications in Boomi, I showcased expertise in orchestrating intricate integrations, ensuring 
                smooth data flow across diverse applications and databases. My role involved extensive interaction with various APIs, customizing 
                integrations to suit specific organizational needs and facilitating streamlined communication. Additionally, I adeptly navigated the 
                features of different cloud providers, integrating their services to design scalable and flexible integration solutions that empowered 
                the organization to optimize its operations in the cloud environment. These experiences allowed me to refine my skills in 
                integration architecture, API management, and cloud integration, ultimately contributing to achieving seamless and effective 
                integration outcomes.
